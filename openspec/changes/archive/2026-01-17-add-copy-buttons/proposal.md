## Why

Users need to copy system information values to share with support or documentation. Currently only Machine Name and Version have copy buttons. Adding copy buttons to more frequently-copied fields improves usability.

## What Changes

- Add copy to clipboard button beside OS Name
- Add copy to clipboard button beside Build
- Add copy to clipboard button beside Edition
- Add copy to clipboard button beside System Locale
- Add copy to clipboard button beside CPU Model

## Impact

- Affected specs: `main-ui`
- Affected code: `DefaultApp/Views/MainPage.xaml`, `DefaultApp/Strings/en-US/Resources.resw`
