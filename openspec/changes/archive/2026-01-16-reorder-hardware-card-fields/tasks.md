## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Reorder XAML elements in MainPage.xaml to move CPU Model, Processor Count, and Total RAM to the top of the Hardware card
- [x] 1.2 Update localization order in Resources.resw if display order affects resource file organization (not needed - resource file is a dictionary, order doesn't affect display)
- [x] 1.3 Build and verify the new layout displays correctly

## 2. Validation

- [x] 2.1 Run the application and verify the new field order matches the specification
- [x] 2.2 Run existing tests to ensure no regressions (10 tests passed)
