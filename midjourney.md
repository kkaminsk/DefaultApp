## Usage Notes

- Add `--stylize 250` for more artistic interpretation or `--stylize 50` for closer prompt adherence
- Use `--no text, words, letters` if unwanted text appears
- Re-roll with `--seed [number]` to get variations of a good result
- Export at highest resolution, then resize for asset sizes per `graphics.md`
